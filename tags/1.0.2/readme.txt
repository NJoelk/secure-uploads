This is a simple plugin to protect your wp-content/uploads folder from being browsed and people downloading your content
(Based on the plugin “Secure Folder wp-content/uploads” made by Daniel Satria)

== Description ==
This plugin will put blank index.php in every sub-directory of your wp-content/uploads folder to prevent people from stealing your content.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this do every folder? =

Yes, the plugin will put the index.php in every sub-directory wp-content/uploads but it only does it when you click the "Secure uploads now!" button to start the process.

No, all this does is protects your uploads from people downloading your content that they can access by browsing your wp-content/uploads folder
